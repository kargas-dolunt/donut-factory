# Specialties

Instead of picking items from each category, you can choose a package known as a **role** that combines various abilities, skills, backgrounds, contacts, and gear.

> Create a set of specialties for your game, to fit and define your setting. Most games have 4 to 6 available specialties. Each specialty generally gives you two Skills and a Talent or one or two items of Gear (including starship or base upgrades).
