# Mecha

Choose your character’s profession: 

+ SECURITY: Exo-Rig with 1× GORGON part. 
+ RESCUE: Exo-Rig with 1× EAGLE part. 
+ HEAVY: Exo-Rig with 1× RHINO part. 
+ TECH: Exo-Rig with 1× MANTIS part. 
+ COURIER: Exo-Rig with 1× LYNX part. 
+ MEDIC: Exo-Rig with 1× CHIRON part. 

You can equip up to four pieces of Exo-Rig gear  – one piece to ARMS, LEGS, CORE, and HEAD. 

Indicated next to each type of gear is the skill it  gives you. The skills listed here, and all similar  physical skills, or skills requiring specialist  equipment, cannot be attempted unless you  equip the relevant gear. Equipping one piece  means you can roll a d6 to use that skill,  equipping two gives a d8, three pieces gives a  d10, and equipping all four pieces gives a d12. 

Buy from nano-lab for listed $SCRAP per piece; or (GM) roll one d6 to equip a Humanoid enemy. 

Anyone can repair broken gear at a nano-lab for half its $CRAP value, rounded down.

Most enemies also have parts – ARMS, LEGS, CORE and HEAD – and carry weapons. 

When you attack an enemy, choose to either just reduce it to $CRAP, or target its parts to disable  it and/or farm its gear/weapons (no $CRAP). 

Each enemy has a level equal to: successful hits  needed to reduce them to $CRAP; distinct parts  to damage to totally disable them; and amount of $CRAP they give (all players) on death. 

A player’s captured $CRAP is returned to the  player who lost it when that enemy is defeated.
