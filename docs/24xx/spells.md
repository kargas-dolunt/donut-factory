# Spells

1. _ANIMATION_: Enchant clay or wood effigies (or corpses) to act as autonomous servitors.
1. _APPORT_: Teleport a nearby target (which could be yourself) to another place nearby.
1. _BOLT_: Strike a target with lightning.
1. _BOON_: Helps 1 target at a time with 1 skillset.
1. _CHARM_: Target treats you as a friend until something leads them to question this.
1. _DARKNESS_: Block all light in an area nearby.
1. _DISGUISE_: Resemble someone or something.
1. _DIVINATION_: Answers a yes-or-no question. Each casting requires new entrails to study, remains to question, or birds to analyze.
1. _FLAME_: Conjures fire to hold in hand or throw.
1. _FOG_: Conjure a thick cloud, impairing vision.
1. _HOLD_: Immobilize a target nearby.
1. _INVISIBILITY_: Make yourself invisible. Taking any risk also risks breaking this effect.
1. _LEVITATION_: Lift and move a person-sized target (potentially yourself) at walking speed.
1. _LIGHT_: Conjure a glowing orb, floating nearby.
1. _MIND-READING_: Sense all thoughts nearby.
1. _PHANTASM_: Conjure an image or sound that appears lifelike, but only at first glance.
1. _PROJECTION_: Enter a trance & send your mind out as a floating, intangible, luminous spirit.
1. _SLEEP_: Put as many targets to sleep as the highest die rolled when casting.
1. _TRANSFIGURATION_: Touch someone to transform their body into another shape.
1. _WARDING_: Invisible, impassible dome or wall.

**DURATION**: Spell effects last until their caster chooses to cancel them or falls unconscious.

**BATTLE MAGIC**: Casting in battle may risk side effects and harm in 1 roll.

**MAGNIFICATION**: With Wizardry or Theurgy, face greater risk to boost effects (e.g., hurl a giant fireball with Flame that endangers you or allies).

**ITEMS**: Anyone can use spells bound in 1-use concoctions (no roll needed) and artifacts (roll Reason or Presence, depending on source, unless “always on,” like boots with a boon to running).
