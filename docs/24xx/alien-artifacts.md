# Artifacts

Artifacts are small, unstable, single-use alien and/or ancient devices — inspired by combining 2 words from the lists below. The exact function is up to the GM to interpret, but player suggestions are encouraged. (These lists can also inspire stable exotic artifacts, but players don’t start with any.)

IDENTIFICATION: You recognize items on sight as artifacts. When you try to determine what they do, you risk (1–2) accidental activation or (3–4) only getting a vague sense of function. Rolling again yields no further information.

INSTABILITY: When you risk harm while carrying 4 or more xot, the roll also indicates whether your xot activate or act unpredictably (1–2) at once or (3–4) with just enough warning to throw them. Xot litter the world. They are powerful and dangerous to hoard. Use or trade them often.

ARTIFACT USE: When you use an exotic artifact in a risky situation, the roll also indicates whether it is depleted (1–2) already, or (3–4) after this use.

TRADE: 1 xot is worth 1 useful tool or weapon, or 1 bulky scrap bundle. Artifacts are worth 10+ xot.
