# Opponents

OPPONENTS: The GM doesn’t roll skill dice. Instead, they describe characters based on...

+ Behavior: What do they do to get what they want? Beasts just want to eat, sleep, reproduce, protect themselves, and maybe protect their mates and their young. Sapient beings have more complex drives. Not everyone just wants to kill you.
+ Risks: If the players come in conflict with this character, what do the players risk? (Maybe they’ve got a knife, or it’s big enough to kill you just by stepping on you.) The GM should signal this when introducing a potential opponent, before anyone initiates conflict. If conflict would risk nothing (an unwary, vulnerable, isolated target), players don’t roll.
+ Obstacles: Would anything prevent players from overcoming this opponent in one roll? As above, the GM signals this before players roll. (You need to find a way through their armor first, or there’s too many to take on alone.) If there are no obstacles, an opponent — even a group — can be defeated in one roll.

Example: This boss has 5 steps

RESHKIGAL: Airlock warning: No weapons permitted in metamind chamber. (Tools OK.)

+ Entry is at its eye-level; target of gaze risks death by laser.
+ Leap to its shoulder (risk death by fall)
+ climb behind head
+ sever cable 1
+ sever cable 2
