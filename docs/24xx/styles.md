# Styles

Styles are an alternative to skills that focus on your personality rather than your training.

The default styles are:

- **Careful**: Attack without collateral damage. Dismantle a lock quietly. Often risks delay or weaken effects.
- **Clever**: Attack the chandelier over a foe. Pick a lock with a credit card. Often risks unseen side effects.
- **Flashy**: Attack to misdirect or provoke. Taunt guards into opening a door. Often risks TOO MUCH attention.
- **Forceful**: Attack hard and fast. Kick in the door. Often risks collateral damage.

You can rename styles to make them fit your game better. Here are some examples:

- *Careful*: Precise, Cautious, Patient, Fussy
- *Clever*: Nerdy, Brainy, Wily, Crafty
- *Flashy*: Showy, Noisy, Sassy, Zany
- *Forceful*: Direct, Gutsy, Reckless, Stormy
