# Hacking Programs

PROGRAMS

Illegal hacking programs can be purchased or developed for ₡1 each. Execute instantly with a
vidlink, cyberdeck, or jailbroken neural link. Spend an override key to avoid risk, or roll Tech as per hacking rules. If detected, you also reveal the location of anyone with a copy of the program you used. (For added security, only buy from trusted vendors, or make your own and refuse to share.)

1. **ALARM**: Trigger all alarm systems in vicinity.
2. **BOND**: Target bot treats you as a friendly.
3. **BYPASS**: Opens one electronic lock, or all electronic locks in the room — your call.
4. **CEASEFIRE**: Disable all nearby weaponry.
5. **COMMAND**: Force a cybernetic part or bot to take an action (e.g., make a cyber-arm wave).
6. **CRASH**: Knock out a cybernetic part, bot, or a human with a neural link.
7. **DUPE**: Generate 1 untraceable, counterfeit credit (₡) at a time; it self-deletes in minutes.
8. **FLASH**: Overload a handheld or worn device, breaking it and injuring its bearer.
9. **FINGER**: APB tags someone as cop killer.
10. **FOLLOW**: Track a target with a worm that jumps between surveillance systems.
11. **LIST**: Identify and locate all tech nearby — cameras, cyberware, weapons, etc.
12. **MUTE**: Block target’s comms, sensory input.
13. **PUPPET**: Focus completely to “possess” a drone, self-driving vehicle, or other bot.
14. **QUERY**: Locate and copy a recorded memory from a bot or a human with a neural link.
15. **RENDER**: Control local holo-emitters and/or AR feeds to project a brief illusion.
16. **SNIFF**: Remotely spy through a specific device (e.g., camera, bot, AR goggles).
17. **SPIKE**: Trigger stress response in someone with a neural link or nerve mesh.
18. **SPOOF**: Generate false ID and credentials stolen from a nearby or pre-selected target.
19. **STITCH**: Summon a medical first responder drone to heal injuries of all people present.
20. **WIPEOUT**: Erase previous and next few minutes of recordings from nearby cameras



+ **COPY**: Duplicate a small object. Hinder(d4) for something bigger than you, up to car-sized.
+ **CHOWN**: An item you specify is recognized as yours, legally and in public opinion. (The previous owner might pretend otherwise.)
+ **DELETE**: A small item you touch ceases to exist — a gun, a doorknob, a laptop, etc.
+ **FIND**: Unerringly locate an item, either general (“a gun”) or specific (“this door’s key”).
+ **KILL**: Touch to induce cardiac arrest. No effect on daemons. Being seen using this will turn many principled codebreakers against you.
+ **MOVE**: Move with preternatural speed and grace — jump across rooftops, scale walls, etc.
+ **PING**: Sense everything around you, as if by radar. Helps when someone sneaks up on you.
+ **RESTORE**: Reveal an injury is not as bad as it looked, removing a hindrance.
+ **SHIFT**: Momentarily exert invisible force on an object — bend a spoon, guide a bullet, etc.
+ **SUDO**: Force an object to perform or cease its function — stall an engine, unlock a door, etc.
+ **SUSPEND**: Gently pause someone a short while, as if entranced. No effect on daemons**.**
