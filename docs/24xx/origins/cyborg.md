# Cyborg

In some settings, cybernetics require a "cyborg" origin. In others, cybernetics are treated as gear items. If the setting uses the cyborg origin, you start with ₡10 to purchase prosthetics and upgrades. If the setting treats cybernetics as gear, they are purchased as normal gear.

Basic cyber-prosthetics cost ₡1 each, must be installed by a surgeon, and are used to repair or replace damaged body parts. However, they can also be upgraded at the cost of  ₡1 per upgrade, giving them additional functions.

1. **Bodyware** (upgrade with active camouflage, dermal armor (+1 break), healing nanobots, oxygen supply)
2. **Cyberaudio** (upgrade with echolocation, noise protection, sound recorder, ultrasonic/subsonic)
3. **Cyberarms** (upgrade with armor (+1 break), super-strength, tool implants, weapon implants)
4. **Cyberlegs** (upgrade with armor (+1 break), compartments, shock absorbers, super-speed)
5. **Cyberoptics** (upgrade with flash protection, low-light, telescopic, x-ray)
6. **Headware** (upgrade with computer implant, sensory recorder, skillsofts, voice mimic)
