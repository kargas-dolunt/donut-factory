Elemental Super Skills represent your character’s ability to control the specified element. Once an element is chosen, rename the super skill to specify exactly how it is
controlled and what it does (ex. Fire Blasts, Kinetic Shields, Control Emotions, Demonic
Familiar, Ice Weapons, etc.)

Examples of Elemental control: Create, Manipulate, Blast, Strike, Shield, Aura, Heal, Form, Area, Movement, Weapon, Ally/Familiar. Other Super Skills are powers commonly seen in superpowered stories. If needed, you should rename the super skill to be more specific. (ex. Super Weapon→Thunder Hammer, Unhuman Comms.→Speak with Birds, Object Affinity→Open Any Lock, Super Training→Martial Arts Master, etc.)
