# Skillsets

If you want to simplify skills, you can combine them into skillsets. Most 24xx games use 4 skillsets. You should customize the names of skillsets to reflect your game and setting.

## Example Skillsets

- **Command**: Use for persuasion, willpower, inspiration (useful for helping allies), etc.
- **Maintenance**: Use for manual labor, repairs, operating machinery, spacewalking, etc.
- **Science**: Use for computers, chemistry, medicine, research, etc.
- **Security**: Use for shooting, fighting, running, climbing, stealth, etc

+ Marine: shooting, fighting, running, etc.
