# Details

# Names

> Offer some names that make sense in your  setting. You can add a table for how the character 
appears, or clothing or unusual items. Help the players enter the world through their character.
>
> Below is a different type of table. Rolling two dice and adding them together creates what is called  a bell curve, where middle results are more likely than those at 2 or 12. By rolling one dice then another, and looking up the numbers separately, each entry has an equal chance.
