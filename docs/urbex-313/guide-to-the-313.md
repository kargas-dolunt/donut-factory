# Major Ruins

Here are some of the better-known ruins in Detroit.

## Belle Isle Zoo
The Belle Isle Zoo was opened in 1895 and once had about 150 different animals, including polar bears, kangaroos and elephants. It was closed in 2002 when Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick decided to save some cash and shut it down. Now the area is quiet, left totally abandoned. Some say a number of dangerous animals escaped, and still roam the area.

 ## Detroit School Book Depository
 Located at 2230 Dalzelle Street, this building was built by architect Albert Kahn and constructed in the early 1900s. The building was originally used as a post office before it was converted into a giant stockroom for the city’s public school records, books, and other supplies. However, in 1987, a fire razed much of the warehouse. The owners wrote it off as a loss, and abandoned the entire structure, including all of the books inside, some dating back to the 1800s. It is rumored that there are spellbooks scattered amongst the wreckage, if you can somehow sort through it. Undead are attracted to the residual magic in the building, and have been known to eat trespassers.

## Fisher Body 21
Located at the I-94 and I-75 interchange, the Fisher Body 21 is a 600,000 square feet former auto plant on a 4.7 acre parcel of land owned by the City of Detroit. The former auto body plant was built in 1919, has been vacant since 1993, and is located at 6051 Hastings Street. There are 6 levels to the ruin. Parts of the building are dangerously unstable, so be sure to check for collapsing floors. It's said that the place is home to gang of cannibal mutants, others say they are actually carnivorous alien invaders. No one know for sure.

> Note: In the real world, there are plans to demolish Fisher Body 21, but by 2023 it has still not happened, and the building is starting to collapse.

## Michigan Central Station
Michigan Central Station (also known as Michigan Central Depot or MCS) is the former main intercity passenger rail station in Detroit, Michigan. Built for the Michigan Central Railroad in 1913, the station remained open for business until the cessation of Amtrak service on January 6, 1988. The station building consists of a train depot and an office tower with thirteen stories, two mezzanine levels, and a roof height of 230 feet (70 m). The building is located in the Corktown district of Detroit behind Roosevelt Park. A lot of people have disappeared exploring this place, and there are no surviving witnesses, so _something_ dangerous must hide within.

> Note: In the real world, the station was bought by Ford motor company in 2018 and is being renovated into an automotive technology center.

## Packard Plant
Odd Detroit's version of a "megadungeon", the Packard Plant occupies 3,500,000-square-feet (325,000 m2) on 40 acres (16 ha) of land, and is located on East Grand Boulevard on Detroit's east side. It consists of a number of structures with up to 7 stories on both sides of the road, storage sheds, outbuildings, and so on. There are also underground tunnels connecting the various buildings.

In the 1990s the Packard plant was a popular place for raves. Nowadays it is inhabited by just about any bad thing you can imagine: predatory animals, cryptids, undead, and so on.

> Note: In the real world, demolition of the Packard Plant began in 2022, but was still ongoing in 2024.

## St. Agnes Church
This Catholic church closed its doors in 2006 due to financial troubles and supernatural events. More recently, Bigfoot sightings have been reported here.

## Vanity Ballroom
This "Aztec" Art Deco structure was once a popular place for Detroiters to dance the night away in the 1930s and 40s. However, it closed for good in the 1990s. While it continues to crumble due to its age, some of the decor remains intact. Supposedly the place is haunted by the ghosts of  depression-era dancers, and even mobsters from the Purple Gang.

## Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church
Located at 8501 Woodward Avenue, and built in 1911 in the Gothic Revival style. It was abandoned with the death of its pastor in 2005. There are rumors that this church is used by cultists for summoning demons.

## Abandoned Homes
Not ready to play with the big kids? There are tens of thousands of abandoned homes around the city where you can explore, battle cryptids, and loot artifacts.

# Subterra

Below the city of Weird Detroit is _Subterra_, a world of caverns, tunnels, and ancient cities that is home to mutants, variforms, and other cryptids. 

There are several different ways to get to Subterra.

## Steam Tunnels
As with many older cities, a series of steam tunnels runs underneath Odd Detroit. Steam pipes and utility lines run through these tunnels, with enough room for maintenance workers to walk through them. There are occasional utility holes leading up to the street level, and you can even enter some large buildings through them, though the entrances are always locked. When a utility worker goes missing, it usually means a new tunnel has broken through to Subterra.

[![DetroitSteamTunnel.jpg](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/uploads/images/gallery/2024-01/scaled-1680-/detroitsteamtunnel.jpg)](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/uploads/images/gallery/2024-01/detroitsteamtunnel.jpg "A Detroit Thermal worker walks along a steam pipe in an underground Detroit tunnel. Dorothy Hernandez/WDET")

## Salt Mines
A huge salt mine sits 1,000 feet under Southwest Detroit and covers an incredible 15,000 acres. The mine has been active since 1910, and still produces road salt for much of the state. Detroit Salt Company offers tours of the mines, but of course, they have blockaded the more dangerous tunnels. The deepest tunnels connect directly to the ancient cities of Subterra, and are guarded by the elves to keep the dwarves out of the human world.

> In the real world, Richard Shaver was working as a welder in Detroit, when his brother died unexpectedly. He fell into an alcoholic depression, and started having paranoid thoughts. At first he believed his brother had been killed by mobsters, but then he began hearing voices. 
>
> After disappearing for a few years, Shaver resurfaced and claimed he had been abducted and held prisoner underground by dwarf-like beings called _Dero_, and was eventually rescued by the beautiful _Tero_. _Amazing Stories_ published Shaver's tales of abduction, and other people around the world wrote back to the magazine, sharing supposedly similar stories of their own.
>
> During the years Shaver said he was underground, he had actually been in a mental institution. Shaver's tale showed many signs of psychosis paranoia, delusions, auditory hallucinations, and so on.  People accused the editor of _Amazing Stories_ of exploiting a mentally ill person, and eventually interest in his accounts faded. Despite the pseudoscience and bad writing in his stories, they were very popular, and may have influenced later alien abduction tales. The Dero even appear in _Dungeons & Dragons_ as "Derro".

## Gangs
The major gangs found in Detroit include:

+   [Black Mafia Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mafia_Family "Black Mafia Family")
+   [Chaldean Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldean_Mafia "Chaldean Mafia")
+   [Detroit Partnership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Partnership "Detroit Partnership")
+   [Devils Diciples Motorcycle Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Diciples_Motorcycle_Club "Devils Diciples Motorcycle Club")
+   [Highwaymen Motorcycle Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwaymen_Motorcycle_Club "Highwaymen Motorcycle Club")
+   [Juggalo gangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggalo_gangs "Juggalo gangs")
+   [Latin Counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Counts "Latin Counts")

Law enforcement subdivides gangs into "sets" that cover a particular region, and "cliques" that claim specific neighborhoods. The [Detroit Sets & Cliques](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1DoDpgLSdHmsdFJXjqsbybzyDZUKJ59vw&hl=en&femb=1&ll=42.39803623146344%2C-83.14636575984619&z=12) map, put together by the "/CrimeInTheD" subreddit, maps out a number of these subgroups in 2024 (I can't find data for 2008).

> I'm not going to go into any additional detail about real Detroit gangs, because I don't want to offend any local gang members.

# DJ Magic

DJ power words can be combined in the following ways:
* Ethereal Element + Ethereal Form
* Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Form
* Ethereal Effect + Ethereal Element

Each power word must be associated with a specific music track, and the track must be associated with the city in some way.

Casting a spell using a mix costs 1 fatigue. Creating a new mix requires a long rest. You can only have one mix prepared at a time.

# Principles for Guides

> Suckers steady lookin' for the M-O-N-E-Y and  
> Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'

## Information

- Information should never be kept behind rolls.
- Provide information readily and freely to facilitate critical thinking and clever play.
- Elicit questions from players and give them direct answers.
- Mysteries should be layered, leading players ever deeper into the odd.

## Secrets

- Leverage the themes of wealth, criminal conspiracies, and the weird.
- Provide information on the things that the players experience, but keep what's going on behind the scenes just beyond their reach.
- Slowly give scrappers opportunities to pull at threads, drawing them deeper into the odd.
- The scale of capitalism, corruption, and crime is incomprehensible. True understanding is unattainable.

## Preparation

- Make the world alive, allow it to change and grow because of your players’ actions.
- Be flexible in your preparation. Create situations and possibilities. Plot and story should not be predefined.
- Give NPCs and factions motivations, flaws and drives. Have NPCs react accordingly to their principles, on and off screen. NPCs should always have a drive to survive.
- Play to find out what happens.

## Difficulty

- Realism and fictional positioning are a good starting place for setting difficulty.
- Choices should have consequences and all failure should be interesting.
- Saves cover various scenarios of uncertainty and risk. If there is neither, do not call for a roll.
- Reward cleverness and ingenuity.

## Danger

- The risk is great for lasting harm, mental and emotional trauma, and the overwhelming danger of cryptids and law enforcement.
- Present the potential of danger clearly for players and give them the opportunity to react.
- Increasing the amount of stress will increase the rate scrappers are killed, injured, or traumatized.

## Choice

- Offer tough choices.
- All situations should have multiple outcomes.
- Clarify player intent before dice are rolled to make sure players have all information that would be obvious to their character.
- Every action should leave an impact on the world in some way.

## Failure

- Failure should push the story forward.
- Foster a table where success and failure are equally exciting.
- It is encouraged to elicit complications or twists from players.

## Die of Fate

- Sometimes randomness is required. Roll 1d6 to consult the die of fate
- 6: Good result/ 4-5: Mixed result/ 1-3: Bad result

# Random Explorations

Motor City madness has touched the countryside And the people rise in anger and the streets begin to fill And there's gunfire from the rooftops and the blood begins to spill Black Day in July 
- Gordon Lightfoot

# Maps

When you need a map for your exploration, roll d12 and consult the list of maps below. If six encounter nodes isn't enough for your exploration, just roll again and chain the exit of the previous map onto the entrance of the next map.

These maps are _node_ maps, which means they don't need to accurately line up with the geography of the area being explored. However, if you want to use the maps for directdional orientation, rotate the map so the entrance is on the correct side. If you are chaining maps together, you can rotate the next map however you prefer, and move the entrance so it lines up with the previous exit.

> This mapping system was blatantly stolen from _Eco Mofos_.

## Map Key
! = Encounter
$ = Reward

One you have your map generated, consult the following pages to determine the content of each node.

# House Layouts

# Factory Layouts

There are four types of factory layouts:

## Assembly Line
Because of Detroit's automotive history, this is the most common type of factory layout. A product moves from one end of the assembly line to the other, with workstations at which a machine, robot, or worker repeatedly performs one step in the assembly process.

## Process
A process layout has multiple employees with similar tasks working together, and is more common with skilled labor. For example, a saxophone factory might have a process area where technicians test a completed instrument's acoustic and mechanical performance. This takes a highly variable amount of time and is not suitable for an assembly line.

## Fixed-Position
The factory builds large objects that remain in fixed positions, such as airplanes or ships. Workers must bring their tools and supplies to the item being built.

## Combination
A combination of two or three of the other types. For example, repairing an aircraft might require a fixed-position layout, but if some of the parts are assembled on-site, the facility will also have a process layout for those tasks.

# Sample Exploration: Nubian Beauty

After arson shut down the _Nubian Beauty_ wig shop on the south side of 8 Mile road, the neighborhood experienced a spike in missing persons. Nobody connected the two until the neighborhood watch noticed a mysterious figure slipping into the wig shop at night. They called the police, who showed no interest in investigating without a body.

One of the watch members knows one of the PCs, and the crew is here to investigate and loot the shop. Five people have gone missing, and the families of the missing people have pooled together a $250 reward for each person rescued, or $100 for each body found.

The cause of the problem is a pack of _manchon à roulers_. Reports of these cryptids date back to the 1700s, and they resemble small heaps of fur or hair, under which is an octopus-like body, complete with tentacles.

When manchon à roulers move, they look like tumbleweeds rolling in the breeze, giving them their common name of "rollers". They attack by leaping onto your head and inserting a bone-tipped tentacle into your brainstem, allowing one to control you like a puppet. As a "wig zombie" you must subdue more victims for them. Eventually you die of neglect, at which time the rollers eat your body.

The rollers, which are intelligent, decided that a wig shop was the perfect place for a lair, and have set about kidnapping people in the neighborhood.

> Notes: This adventure was heavily influenced by "New Rats in Old Bastion".
>
>This exploration is set in an abandoned wig store, but I couldn't find one in 2008 Detroit, so I cheated and used one from a different time and place. _Nubian Beauty Supply_ was across the border from Detroit on the Warren side of 8 Mile Road, in the Mohawk Plaza strip mall. The plaza was abandoned after an arson in 2019, but later refurbished, and now the wig shop is a salon.
>
>Warren is best known as the hometown of Eminem, and 8 Mile Road was featured in Eminem's semi-autobiographical movie "8 Mile". 

## Map Key

### 1: Front Entrance
The front door and the windows of the shop are boarded up. Tearing down the boards requires a claw hammer, prybar, or similar tool. This will make a bunch of noise, and alert the creatures inside, but because the neighbors know about the PCs, no one will call the police.

 ⬆️ Boarded door to 4.

### 2: Alley
The back door opens into an alley. A dumpster next to the door smells like rotten meat. Inside are two headless corpses. Examining them requires a WIL save to resist the stench, but will reveal that they match the description of missing people, and both have been partly eaten. The door is closed, but unlocked.
 
A sheet of paper is on the ground next to the door and the words "XMAS 2006" are hand-written on it in red marker.  For some reason, the rollers are obsessed with Christmas, and chose the day of Christmas displayed on the backroom calendar, "Monday", as the password to open the magical lock they placed on the door to area 5. This message was written by one of the victims who became a wig zombie, but broke free after a trip and fall knocked the roller off her head. They caught up with her though, and now her headless corpse is in the dumpster.
 
If the PCs report the bodies to the police, they will show up, and the adventure is over, at least until the cops turn into wig zombies.

 ⬅️ Door to 3.

### 3: Back Room
The back room has a desk with a chair, a table with a coffee machine and a dirty microwave, and some storage shelves. Next to a notice board, a calendar on the wall is set to December 2006, and the date of Christmas, Monday December 25, is circled in red marker. There are a few Christmas decorations put up: tinsel, a few ornaments, and a snow globe on a desk.

On one of the storage shelves is an unopened and undamaged box of beauty products: shampoos, conditioners, hair relaxers, hair dye, etc. The PCs can get 2d6 x $10 for it.

Inside a large desk draw is blessed painter's tape, magical spray paint, and a Witchlock stencil. This tag magic kit can be sold for 2d6 x $100.

|Witchlock|
|:--|
Magically locks and wards a door so it requires a password to unlock, and cannot be broken open without blast damage. Casting the spell costs d4 points of WIL.| 

⬇️ Curtained doorway to 4.  
➡️ Door to 2.

### 4: Main Room
"Nubian Beauty supply shelves")

The main room is dark because the windows and front door are boarded up. A faint humming sound fills the air (from the door to 5). In the middle of the room are three free-standing shelves containing damaged and looted beauty supplies, and atop the shelves are mannequin heads wearing wigs (see photo). Mannequin heads wearing wigs also line wall shelves on three sides of the room. The drop ceiling is falling apart, and the room shows signs of fire damage. The wigs all smell like smoke, making them worthless.

There are three wig zombies in this room, and two of them match the descriptions of missing people. All three of them appear to be wearing elaborate wigs. Two are just standing around, while the third is crouched behind the front counter, keeping an eye on the front door.

When they spot the PCs, they will mutter "brains!", shuffle toward the crew, and attempt to beat them into submission so that the four other rollers in the room will have easy prey. One roller is hiding in the drop ceiling, 2 are hiding on mannequin heads atop the free-standing shelves, and one is sitting on a severed head on a wall shelf. This head matches the man's body in the dumpster.

Make it clear that the zombies are emaciated, but definitely still alive. If the PCs attack the zombies instead of going after the wigs/rollers, one of the zombies will gasp "help me!". If they kill a wig zombie, the roller on it will "play dead", then leap up to attack when the crew least suspects it. If freed, the zombies will be grateful, and run for their lives. If the PCs start freeing victims, or kill all the zombies, the other rollers will attempt a surprise attack.

**Roller x7**
|STR 5, WIL 7, HP 3, d4 tentacle|
|:--|
|Critical: Become a wig zombie|

**Wig Zombie x3**
|HP 0, d4 DEX punch|
|:--|
Meat Shield: Attacking the roller will also harm the wig zombie.
Rug Pull: You can pull the roller off the victim if it fails a STR save.


⬆️  Curtained doorway to 3.  
⬇️ Boarded door to 1.  
⬆️ Magically locked door to 5.  

### 5: Employee Bathroom
The door to the bathroom is shut and emitting a soft humming sound. It is magically locked, and will not open, but the PCs could smash a hole through the wall to enter. If someone knocks or strikes the door, a voice (from the severed head) will ask "What day is Christmas?". The password to open the door is "Monday."

Inside, the zombies have set up a bizarre shrine. A severed head sits upon the toilet lid, surrounded by Christmas lights, glowing with magical energy despite the lack of electricity. On top of the toilet tank is a "Wig Warehouse" catalog. On the head rests a bright red wig. It has been magically transformed by the presence of the cryptids.

|Disguise Wig|
|:--|
|Charges   ⃝ ⃝ ⃝
Recharge: Place the wig on a human corpse
While wearing this wig, you can change your appearance to look like anyone you have seen in a photograph. This includes changes to height and weight. Your voice and mannerisms do not change.

⬇️ Door to 4.

## Aftermath
If the PCs accidentally kill any wig zombies, they can cover it up if they wish. The families won't know how they died, and will still pay them. Eventually though, an autopsy will reveal the manner of death.

When the PCs leave the shop for the last time, they spot another roller on top of a sewer grate, it quickly falls through it, before they can take any action. If they follow it into the sewers, they will find a much larger lair, but that's an adventure for another time.
