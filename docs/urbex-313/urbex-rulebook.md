# Welcome 2 Detroit

> Welcome to the D, baby It’s all live down here What you see is all real. J Dilla about to set it the fuck off!
-\ J Dilla

The timeline of **Urbex 313** beings on October 1, 2008, as the economy collapses into the Great Recession. Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick resigned from his office on September 18 after a corruption scandal and rumors of other crimes, up to and including murder.

Many people in the city of Detroit have lost their jobs due to the recession, and the population has dropped from a high of two million in 1950 to under a million in 2000. The mass exodus, caused by the decline of the auto industry and white flight, have left  80,000 abandoned buildings scattered throughout the city.

Kilpatrick's replacement, city council president Kenneth Cockrel Jr, is saddled with a large geographic area, a shrinking tax base, and not enough money to fund basic city services like trash removal and demolishing ruined buildings.

These ruins attract all kinds of weirdness: drug addicts, squatters, wild animals, gangs, cultists, and even secret government laboratories. You know, the usual.

You are unemployed and flat broke. You've always been a little odd, but now you and a bunch of other misfits have banded together to loot the city's ruins. You will strip buildings of copper pipes, wiring, tin ceilings, decorative stonework, or whatever else you can find. Scrapyards around the city give you an easy place to dispose of your ill-gotten gains without the law asking too many questions.

You have plenty of competition though: other scrapping crews, street gangs, and business interests are all trying to make a quick buck off the city's misfortune. You're not worried though, you plan to come out on top.

> Note: In the real world, Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013. After shedding debt, it established a land bank to auction off about half of the abandoned properties, and a demolition program to tear down the other half. By 2023 nearly 20k of the 40k condemned buildings have been demolished.
>
>In 2008, both DTE and AT&T had reported over 800 thefts of copper wire. In 2009, the Detroit PD formed a Copper Theft unit to deal with the problem. The city council passed laws regulating metal scrapyards, and the Great Recession reduced the value of scrap metal. By 2014, copper theft was down almost 90% due to a combination of the police, new regulations, and all the easy copper already being looted.

# The Elephant in the Room

Let's talk about the elephant in the room. You know, _racism_.

This is a fantasy game about exploring abandoned buildings in 2008 Detroit, a city that was 80% African-American, with a shrinking population, and an increasing poverty rate.

>  In the real world, these trends eventually reversed in the late 2010s. Detroit in the 2020s is slowly regaining population, the poverty rate is falling, and the city has grown more racially diverse. This has come at the cost of gentrification, and the displacement of long-time residents of the city.

Racism is a topic that played, and continues to play, a huge role in the development of the city:

**Partial Timeline of Detroit Racism**
+ **1793**: Canada banned slavery, and Detroit, just across the river from Canada, became the final stop in the Underground Railroad.
+ **1833**: an angry mob of African-Americans attacked a sheriff attempting to return fugitive slaves to their owners, allowing the slaves to escape to Canada.
+ **1850s**: Angry German-American mobs repeatedly destroyed brothels catering to black clientele.
+ **1863**: An Irish-American mob attacked black Detroiters, blaming former slaves for the Civil War.
+ **1920s**: Black southerners moved to Detroit in search of high-paying automotive jobs.
+ **1926**: A group of African-American businessmen built a black-friendly cemetery in the nearby city of Warren, becuase cemeteries in Detroit were segregated.
+ **1942-1943**: white mobs attaked African-American Detroiters and battled police over blacks getting war-manufacturing jobs, and housing for those workers being built in white neighborhoods.
+ **1950s**: Redlining prevented African-Americans from getting loans for houses in the suburbs. White Detroiters began moving to the suburbs in a phenomenon known as "white flight". The city's population would steadily decline for the next 70 years.
+ **1967**: Detroit police raided a "blind pig" party for black veterans returning from Vietnam, and arrested the partygoers. This led to three days of rebellion and rioting. The governor called in thousands of National Guard troops (who were mostly white and economically advantaged, because it was a method of avoiding the draft). The National Guard made the situation worse, and things only calmed down after the federal government sent in thousands of paratroopers from the 82nd & 101st Airborne (many of whom were African-American). It ended with 43 deaths (25 caused by the authorities), 1,189 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 400 buildings burned. White flight increases significantly.
+ **1968**: Hundreds of black Detroiters rioted after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Once again, the governor sent in the National Guard.
+ **1971-1974**: The Detroit PD employed "Stop the Robberies, Enjoy Safe Streets" or STRESS, a unit that used decoys to attract potential robbbers. The unit killed 24 people, including 22 black men, in 3 years.
+ **1974**: Partly in response to STRESS, Detroit elected Coleman A. Young, a former Tuskeege Airman, as the city's first black mayor.
+ **1975**:  The white owner of a bar on Livernois Ave shot and killed a black 18-year-old, resulting in two days of protests and rioting.
+ **1995**: Malice Green was beaten to death by flashlight-wielding Detroit PD officers after refusing to drop a vial of crack cocaine. The officers were eventually convicted of either 2nd-degree murder or manslaughter.
+ **2003**: Due to continued abuses, the Detroit PD enters into two consent decrees with the U.S. Dept of Justice.

> **Full Disclosure**: One of my relatives was a high-ranking officer in the Detroit PD, and was in charge of the investigation of former mayor Kwame Kilpatrick.

## TTRPG Blackface
In _Urbex 313_, some of the PCs may be, and many of the NPCs will be African-American. If you are white, don't do "TTRPG blackface". Don't use use an ebonics accent or excessive slang. Don't play into stereotypes about poverty, drugs, gangs, or homelessness. If anyone in your group has problems with this, you are better off playing a different game.
# Safety and Consent

_Urbex 313_ includes many topics from Detroit's history, legend, and fiction that many players may find distressing. I've attempted to treat them in a serious manner, but they include:

+ Alcohol and tobacco use
+ Cannibalism
+ Explicit language
+ Illegal drug use
+ Racism
+ Rape and incest
+ Sex
+ Violence

A number of safety tools have been developed over the years for regulating problematic content. The more popular ones include:

+ [The X-Card](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB0jsx34bWHZWbnNIVVuMjhDkrdFGo1_hSC2BWPlI3A/edit)
+ [Lines and Veils](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22lines+and+veils%22+%22ron+edwards%22)
+ [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/)
+ [TTRPG Safety Toolkit](https://t.co/gA6hV6VKqm)
+ [Consent in Gaming](https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/)
 
One possible method of combining these safety tools is listed below:

## Establish Lines & Veils
Before the first session, ask players to make lists of things in the following catgegories:

+ **Lines**: As in "a red line not to be crossed". These are things that can't be in the game AT ALL. For example, if someone is a recovering addict, they might not want ANY mention of substance abuse in the game. 
+ **Veils**: These are things that can be in the game, but not described or roleplayed. The problematic content is skipped over, or "fades to black" as needed. For example, someone might be OK with sex in the game, but it can't be described or roleplayed. It happens "off screen".

These lists can be submitted verbally, electronically, or anonymously on paper for privacy reasons.

Everyone needs to follow the lines and veils. They are not open for debate. For example, a player might object by saing, "No drugs? But I wanted to play a drug dealer!" If this happens, make it clear that the mental and emotional safety of the other players comes first.

## The X Card
The X-Card is an optional tool (created by John Stavropoulos) that allows anyone in your game (including you) to edit out any content anyone is uncomfortable with as you play. Since most RPGs are improvisational and we won't know what will happen till it happens, it's possible the game will go in a direction people don't want. An X-Card is a simple tool to fix problems as they arise.

To use the X-Card, at the start of your game, say:

> “I’d like your help. Your help to make this game fun for everyone. If anything makes anyone uncomfortable in any way… [ draw X on an index card ] …just lift this card up, or simply tap it [ place card at the center of the table ]. You don’t have to explain why. It doesn't matter why. When we lift up or tap this card, or say "pause", we pause the game, and edit out the thing being X-Carded. And if there is ever an issue, anyone can call for a break and we can talk privately.
>
> I know it sounds funny but it will help us play amazing games together and usually I’m the one who uses the X-card to help take care of myself. [ pause ] Does everyone consent to using the X-Card? [ pause and allow each person to answer ] Is there another tool you would rather use? [ pause and wait for suggestions ] Either way, the people playing here are more important than the game we're playing. Thank you for helping make this game fun for everyone!"

## Rewind, Fast Forward
When someone invokes the X-Card the game PAUSES until the problem is resolved. There are two ways to handle this:

1. **Rewind**: Back the game up to before the problematic issue appeared, and re-start the game, making sure to NOT include the problematic content. Example, "My character wouldn't do that - rewind."
1. **Fast Forward**: This works like a veil - you skip over the problematic issue, and resume the game afterwards. Example, the guide says "The room is full of dead children, they look...", and a player responds "pause, fast forward.", even though "violence against children" was not listed as a veil. The Guide then follows-up with "OK, what now?"

# Overview

> God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)  
> Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)  
> I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps  
> 'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
> 
> \- Bizarre

### Guide and Player
Guides make consistent rulings during play and facilitate situations in which the players can engage with the fiction. The goal is to create interesting stories of rising above a broken system by breaking the rules.

### Player Choice
Guides provide players with as much information as possible in order to be innovative and clever in their problem solving. Risks should be clear, with multiple options for player choice present. Every choice matters.

### No Classes
Scrappers are not limited by a predefined class. A character’s specialty begins with their background, equipment, and experiences.

### Growth
There is no leveling or mechanical experience in _Urbex 313_. Success and failure lead to memorable stories. Building relationships, finding artifacts, and surviving trauma lead to character growth.
### Adaptable
_Urbex 313_ is an adaptable modern ttrpg that can be used to run any type of urban exploration game.
### Death
The world is dangerous and death is always a possible consequence. It should be ever present but never random or unexpected.

Death comes for everyone, but you plan to get rich first.

# Principles for Players

> Go downtown on the street  
> They measure the beat  
> To understand the situation  
> A taste on the tongue  
> And no place to run
>
> \- Sonic’s Rendezvous Band

## Agency
+   The numbers on your character sheet act as tools to mechanically engage with the game. They do not define your character.
+   Use how your character has grown to inform your play.
+   Embrace the weird.

## Teamwork
+   Work to support others at the table.
+   Elicit interaction from other players.
+   Characters don’t always have to be aligned, but players should be aiming toward the same goal of memorable stories of struggle and success, while having fun with friends.

## Talking
+   NPCs have drives and flaws. Interact with them as you would a real person.
+   Build relationships, engage with rivals, and invest in the NPCs.
+   Information and positive outcomes can often be achieved through dialogue. That being said, sometimes a cultist’s communion requires an offering of blood and bone.

## Caution
+   Fighting is risky and the consequences of violence are long lasting.
+   A shattered mind is just as debilitating as a broken body.
+   Gain any advantage you can. Preparation can stave off certain doom.
+   Magic is chaotic and wielding the unknowable can have dire consequences.
+   Victory comes in many forms, and often it is a successful retreat.

## Planning
+   Ask questions.
+   There is no perception or intelligence attribute. How you engage with the world hinges on how you use the information provided.
+   Reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding are necessary for survival.

## Ambition
+   Discover the drives and goals for you as a player, your character, and the team. Use those to inform play.
+   Try and fail forward. An engaging story is infinitely more interesting and memorable than simple successes.
+   It is the complications and resulting actions that we remember afterward.
+   Characters die, but the story will continue.
+   Play to find out what happens.

# Character Creation

# Creating a Character

## Ability Scores
Player Characters (PCs) have three ability scores:

+   **Strength (STR)**: Physicality, brawn & toughness.
+   **Dexterity (DEX)**: Speed, sneaking & precision.
+   **Willpower (WIL)**: Perception, charm & weirdness

When creating a Player Character (PC), the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character’s ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

## Hit Protection
Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting Hit Protection (HP). HP does not indicate a character’s health but reflects their ability to avoid damage (both physical damage and stress). HP can be recovered after a few moments rest. Both **Damage** and **Stress** subtract first from your HP. Some things do Damage, some things do Stress, and some do both.

**#Armor** is a tag that some items have to indicate that they provide protection from damage and reduce it before it is applied to HP. Any excess damage or stress (past 0 HP) is applied to STR.

**#Stability** is a tag that some items have to indicate that they provide protection from stress and reduce it before it is applied to HP. Any excess damage or stress (past 0 HP) is applied to WIL.

## Background
You must have done something before you became a scrapper. Choose or roll from the [Backgrounds](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/books/urbex-rulebook/page/backgrounds) list for more information.

## Starting Gear
All scrappers start with gear based on their weirdness and background. You also start with 3d6 x $10 in cash, which you can use to buy things in the [Gear] chapter.

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots: a backpack or bag (6 slots), hands (2 slots), and body (2 slots). Most items take up one slot, along with #petty items that can be bundled together. Items with the #bulky tag take two slots and are awkward or require two hands.

## Name
You need at least a handle and a personality before starting on your adventures. See the [Names](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/books/urbex-rulebook/page/names) page for more information.

## Age
Choose your age based on your background, or roll 2d20+14 to determine your age randomly.

## Look
Describe your appearance. If you need inspiration, roll on the [Description](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/books/urbex-rulebook/page/description) tables.

## Connections, Contacts, and Companions
Create one connection and one contact. For small player groups (<4), each player may also create one or more companions. See the [Connections, Contacts, and Companions](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/books/urbex-rulebook/page/connections-contacts-and-companions) page for more information.

## Details
+   Answer the [Getting To Know Your Character] questions.
+   Determine the rest of your character’s [traits].

## The Party
The final step is to establish a party set up using the [Party Questions](https://dolunt.net/bookstack/books/urbex-rulebook/page/party-questions) page. This provides the initial context for the scrappers and their explorations.

## Street Name
If you are in an illegal scrapping crew, it's not a good idea to use your real name. So at a minimum, choose a street name (aka call sign, handle). Keep in mind that the origin of your street name is probably more of a teasing insult than a cool compliment.

Your street name also says something important about your character. It gives you a hook for role-playing. If you need inspiration, roll on the table below.

> These names are a combination of military call signs, gangster names, and just silly nicknames.

# Party Questions

>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  
Welcome to Detroit  
Come back soon  
Sorry we _missed_ you  
> 
> \- Trick-Trick

## The Party
Why has the party come together? Use the answers from the Get To Know Your Character section to inform your decision. As a table create your own or use the table below (d6):

| d6  | Result                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | The scrappers meet in a dive bar. They may or may not know each other. Fluorescent lights hum over checkered linoleum. |
| 2   | A simple “wrong place, wrong time.” The resulting event binds the scrappers together.                                  |
| 3   | United through self guided research. Urbex forum? Club? Support group?                                                 |
| 4   | A mysterious patron brought the scrappers together to look for specific items.                                         |
| 5   | Members of the community respond to a series of mysterious events.                                                     |
| 6   | Scrappers that are looking into a mysterious event.                                                                    |
## Character Bonds (optional)
Have each player state a relationship to another character at the table. This should be informed by the background, The Abyss Stares Back, and The Party section of character creation. Some examples are:

|  d6 |                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1   | \_\_\_\_\_ is hiding something from me. |
| 2   | \_\_\_\_\_ is my ex.                    |
| 3   | \_\_\_\_\_ saved my life.               |
| 4   | \_\_\_\_\_ is my drinking buddy.        |
| 5   | \_\_\_ was my co-worker at \_\_\_.      |
| 6   | \_\_\_\_\_ is my neighbor.              |

## Vehicles

Determine as a group what types of vehicle or transportation the party has access to (hint, it won't be nice). The party may have access to more than one vehicle. Car chases are an essential part of urban gaming. Vehicles have STR. When it is reduced to 0 STR it is totaled. Totaling a vehicle can cause damage to those in and around the vehicle.

## Weapon Tags
Weapons are described by **tags** that give you important information about the items size, range, area, critical damage, and other characteristics.

### Auto
Usually found on heavy weapons like machine guns, the weapon can can concentrate fire on a single target. When using concentrated fire, roll the damage dice twice and take the best result.

### Blast
The weapon damages multiple targets in an area. This tag is usually found on explosives or automatic weapons. When in doubt if it can harm all targets in the area, roll the damage die again to determine the number of targets affected.

### Blind
Usually found on weapons like pepper spray, flashbangs, and tear gas grenades. When damaged, the target must make a DEX save or be blinded for d4 turns. Attacks against a blinded opponent are enhanced, and attacks made by them are impaired. If a weapon has both #blind and #deaf, only one save is required. These weapons can still kill if the target fails a critical damage save, or is reduced to 0 HP.

### Deaf
Found on flashbang grenades or powerful explosives. When damaged, the target must make a DEX save or be deafened, causing them to automatically fail further DEX saves until they get a short rest.  If a weapon has both #blind and #deaf, only one save is required. These weapons can still kill if the target fails a critical damage save, or is reduced to 0 HP.

### Bulky
The weapon requires 2 inventory slots to carry, and 2 hands to use effectively.

### Close
Close means the target is within 40 ft, easily reachable in hand-to-hand combat. All melee weapons have this rnage. Attacks with raged weapons are impaired at close range.

### Close/Near
The weapon can be used in hand-to-hand combat range, or ranged combat. Usually applies to thrown weapons, or sawed-off shotguns.

### Stun
Usually found on electrical weapons like tasers and stun guns. When damaged, the target must make a DEX save or fall to the ground helpless for d4 turns. They can still kill if the target fails a critical damage save, or is reduced to 0 STR.

### Far
The target cannot be reached in a single turn. This is betweem 80 and 160 ft. Pistols and primitive ranged weapons like bows and crossbows have this range.

### Near
The target outside hand-to-hand range, but can be reached with a full turn run. This is approximately 40 - 80 feet. Spray weapons like pepper gel, and thrown weapons like grenades have this range.

### Restricted
You can't just go out and buy a fragmentation grenade or a machine gun. These weapons are restricted to either police officers, or the military.

### Slow
You cannot move and use the weapon to attack in the same turn.

## Alcohol
TBD

## Tobacco
TBD

## Tranquilizers
TBD

## Controlled Substances
Most controlled substances are drugs consumed to alter the user's mood. They are restricted or banned, depending on its classification schedule.

(high based on drug, potential WIL or STR save to grapple with negative effects)

## Poison
Poisons are ingested toxic substances. If a PC is about to ingest poison, the guide must provide clues that something is wrong (appearance, smell, etc). If ingested, the victim usually suffers d12 STR loss wthin 3 hours, but poisons vary in potency. On a failed critical damage save, the victim dies. An antidote can reverse the effect if used before the time is up.
## Venom
Venoms are injected toxins. If a PC is attacked by a venomous creature or weapon, the Guide should provide clues (appearance, smell, etc). If an envenomed attack does critical damage, it usually causes d12 STR loss within 1 hour, but venoms vary in potency. An antivenom can reverse the effect if used before the time is up.

 ## Tranquilizers
 If ingested, the subject must make a STR save or lose consciousness for approximately 3 hours.


## Antidote
In Weird Detroit, poison antidotes are alchemical potions can neutralize poison from any source.

## Antivenom
TBD

# Rules

My crew is all fired up (Yeah, yeah) Y'all better just wise up (Woo, woo) Everybody gettin' sized up (C'mon, c'mon) Before we all rise up (Let's go) 
- Hush 

# Core Rules

## Attributes
Each of the three attributes are used in different circumstances (see Saves).

### Strength (STR)
Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

### Dexterity (DEX)
Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

### Willpower (WIL)
Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke,
manipulate spells, etc.

## Saves
+ A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.
+ PCs roll a d20 and compare the result to an appropriate attribute. If they roll equal to or under that attribute, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.
+ If two opponents are both attempting to overcome the other, whoever is most at risk should save.
+ If something **Enhances** a Save, roll d20 twice and take the lower number.
+ If something **Impairs** a Save, roll d20 twice and take the higher number.

## Healing & Recovery
+ Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but may leave the crew exposed. Bandages can stabilize a character that has taken critical damage.
+ Attribute loss (see Critical Damage) can usually be restored with a week’s rest, facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of expertise.
+ Some healing services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

## Deprivation & Fatigue
+ A PC that lacks a crucial need (such as food or rest) is Deprived. Anyone Deprived for more than a day adds Fatigue to their inventory, one for each day. A Deprived PC cannot recover HP, Attributes, or item slots from Fatigue.
+ A PC may also be forced to add Fatigue after casting spells or due to events occurring in the fiction. Each Fatigue occupies one slot and lasts until the PC is able to recuperate (such as a full night’s rest in a safe spot).
+ If a character is forced to add Fatigue to their inventory but they have no free slots, they must drop an item from their inventory.

## Armor Class
+ Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor Class** (**AC**) from the result of damage rolls.
+ Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 AC), but only while the item is held or worn. Some may also provide additional benefits according to their use.
+ A PC, NPC, or monster cannot have more than AC 3.

## Harm Protection
**Harm Protection**, abbreviated **HP**, is a buffer that protects you from being harmed. It represents combat reflexes, experience in predicting the flow of battle, and simple luck.

## Reactions
+ When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table.

|d12 roll|Reaction|
|--|--|
|1| Hostile |
|2-4| Wary |
|5-8| Curious|
|9-11| Kind|
|12| Helpful|
  
## Morale
+ Enemies must pass a WIL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number.
+ Some groups may use their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 HP.
+ Morale does not affect PCs.

## Hirelings
+ Adventuring parties can recruit hirelings, relying on their unique skills, knowledge, and training to aid in expeditions.
+ To create a hireling, choose an appropriate role from the Hirelings table in the Marketplace (pg. 17-18). Roll 3d6 for each attribute, and 1d6 for their HP. Give them equipment appropriate to their station, then roll on the Character Traits tables to further flesh them out.
+ Alternatively, choose an appropriate background and name from the Character Creation guide. Roll (or choose from) the tables for that background. Then, roll for Rations, Gold Pieces, Attributes, HP, and age.

## Die of Fate
+ Optionally, roll 1d6 whenever the outcome of an event is uncertain or to simulate an element of randomness and chance.
+ A roll of 4 or more generally favors the PCs, while a roll of 3 or under usually means bad luck for the PCs.

# Combat Rules

# Combat

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#start-of-combat)Start of combat

At the **Start of Combat**, each PC must make a DEX save for a chance to act before their adversaries.

+   **Success**: The PC may act before their opponent.
+   **Failure**: The PC does not get to go during the Start of Combat round. After the Start of Combat round, order proceeds with PCs acting, then adversaries.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#rounds)Rounds

The game typically plays without strict time accounting. If timing is necessary, use 10 second rounds to keep track. A **round** is comprised of character turns. During each turn all actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#actions)Actions

On their turn a character may move up to 40ft and take up to one action. This may be casting a spell, attacking, making a second move, or some other combat maneuver.

Players state what actions they will take before rolling dice. If they attempt something risky, the Facilitator will call for a save from the appropriate party.

All actions, attacks, and movements take place roughly at the same time.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#attacking--damage)Attacking & Damage

There are no rolls to hit. There are no misses, only varying levels of damage.

On their turn, the attacker rolls their weapon die, subtracts any Armor bonus, and deals the remaining total to the opponent’s HP. Excess damage is then dealt to STR (see Critical Damage)

Some attacks deal Stress instead. These follow the same process of rolling the stress die, subtracting any relevant Stability bonus and then dealing the remaining total to HP. Excess Stress is dealt to CTRL (see [Critical Stress - Fallout Trigger](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/))

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#multiple-attackers)Multiple Attackers

If multiple attackers target the same foe, roll all damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#attack-modifiers)Attack Modifiers

An attack is **Impaired** if the attacker is in a position of weakness that would impact your effectiveness. Impaired attacks deal 1d4 damage. Some examples of a position of weakness are attacking through cover, being bound, mind clouded by shadows.

An attack is **Enhanced** if the attacker is in a position of advantage. Enhanced attacks deal 1d12 damage. Some examples of a position of advantage would be leveraging a daring maneuver, attacking a helpless adversary, or having your arm guided by the void. Unarmed attacks always do 1d4 damage.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#dual-weapons)Dual Weapons

If attacking with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage dice and keep the single highest result.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#blast)Blast

The **blast** quality denotes an attack that hits everything in a target area with damage rolled separately for each affected. Blast can be anything from explosions to spectral tentacles to the impact of a space embryo. If scale is unclear, roll damage dice to determine the number of targets affected.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#retreat)Retreat

Escaping a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination in order to get away. Safely retreating is a victory in its own way.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#critical-damage)Critical Damage

If damage brings a target’s HP below zero, their STR is decreased by the amount remaining. They must then make a STR save to avoid taking **critical damage**.  
Suffering critical damage disables the victim. All they can do is crawl and grasp for life. Aid and rest required to persevere or they will die in the hour.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#critical-stress--fallout)Critical Stress = Fallout

**Stress** that reduces a target’s HP below zero decreases a target’s CTRL by the amount remaining. They must then make a CTRL save to avoid **Critical Stress**.  
If a character fails their CTRL save they take critical stress and gain fallout from the [Stress Fallout](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/) table.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#ability-score-loss)Ability Score Loss

If a PC’s STR is reduced to 0, they die. If their DEX is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If their CTRL is reduced to 0, they are lost.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#unconsciousness--death)Unconsciousness & Death

When a character dies, the player is free to create a new character or take control of an associate. They immediately join the party in order to reduce downtime.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#detachments)Detachments

Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **detachment**. When a detachment takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 STR, it is destroyed.

Attacks against detachments by individuals are **impaired** (excluding blast damage).

Attacks against individuals by detachments are **enhanced** and deal blast damage.

## [](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Combat//#morale)Morale

Morale is a mechanical trigger used to simulate a NPCs’ desire to survive.

Enemies must pass a CTRL save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader’s CTRL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 HP.

Some NPCs transcend measures of morale. Their proximity to the weird means their behavior diverges from other NPCs.

Morale does not affect PCs.

# Stress and Scars

Stress is identical to damage, but targets WIL instead of STR. Stress may come as a result of narrative consequences, failed saves, magic repercussions, or enemy attacks. Stress targets HP before going to WIL.

## Stress Examples
Note: The amount and frequency of how you deal stress establishes the tone and pacing of your game. It is a dial to control the amount of Weird your players encounter and how likely they are to change as a result.

|Stress   | Example  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 Stress | **GLIMPSE**: Encountering the strange or odd. |
| 1d4 Stress | **CONTACT**: The weird and unexplainable. |
| 1d6 Stress | **EXPOSURE**: Directly encountering the unknowable. Reality bends. |
| 1d8 Stress | **CATASTROPHE**: Major Powers, Omens, Catastrophes. Reality is close to breaking. |
| 1d10 Stress | **DOOM**: Direct contact with Titans. Reality rupturing. |

## Scars
Too much stress can leave you magically scarred. Players roll or choose from the the Scars list when the character takes **critical stress**.

Unless marked, the Scar can only be chosen once per list. Each Scar replaces an inventory slot. It cannot be removed.

**Note to Guides:** The tone of the scars list reflects the themes and goals of the game. Adjust for what works for your table, adding or changing entries as needed to ratchet up (or dial back) the weird. This is the main mechanical dial for the horror in your game.

---

1. **Have you been replaced?** You’ve seen what they can do - their magics and their deceptions. What would stop them from taking you? Maybe you're not who you think you are? A clone? An android? How would you even know? During your next moment of quiet reflection, roll d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.
2. 	**Memories of an Unknown Traveler**: These memories are not your own. They are from a different person, who may be from a different place, or different time. Their feelings so foriegn, if only you could understand what they experienced. During your next rest, roll d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.
3. 	**Paranoia**: Is it paranoia if the worries are completely reasonable? You’ve seen what happens in the dark, you know what goes bump in the night. After a week, roll d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.
4. 	**Plagued by Nightmares**: It comes for you every night, without fail. You do not know if they are from the beginning, or the end. All you know is that they won’t stop, and that they must mean something. After a week of nightmares, tell your Guide two distinct images that linger at the edge of your remembering.
5. 	**Mirror World**: Everything seemed okay at first, but now you are sure of it the world is somehow different. The shifting of places, people, it is undeniable. When you first start to notice, roll 2d6. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.
6. 	**Odd**: You adopt an odd behavior that makes others extremely uncomfortable. If you resist indulging in your “Oddity” for 24 hours, take the Deprived tag. If others see you engage in this creepy behavior, they must make a WIL save or take 1d4 Stress. After the first instance, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current WIL, take the new result.
7. 	**Hunger**: You develop an unnatural hunger for something weird (bugs, blood, rocks, etc.). If you do not satiate your appetite for 24 hours, take the Deprived tag. When you eat, restore your HP and cause 1 fatigue to any that can see. After the first instance, roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your current STR, take the new result.
8. 	**Scarred**: Every wound you inflict leaves its ragged mark upon your body. After the first instance, make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max STR by 1d4.
9. 	**Channeling**: It wasn’t noticeable at first, but a spirit is trying to communicate through you. It could be an angel, demon, elemental, ghost, or faerie. If you let it in, increase your max WIL by d4.
10. **Magical Mutation** (this can be taken multiple times per character): Flesh is weak. A part of your body becomes visibly changed through your proximity to the weird. The Guide and Player should decide on how that change manifests and if it has any mechanical impacts.
1. **Threshold:** There is a pale door with a black handle. It is unremarkable other than the fact that this door can seemingly appear anywhere. Sometimes the door is in places it should not be. Sometimes it stands alone, attached to nothing at all. The one thing you are sure of is that it is the same door each time- one you have not yet been able to open. 
1. **Neural Superposition:** You see images of unknown places superposed onto this one, sometimes making it difficult to tell what is real. In another time you may have been called an oracle.   When you roll **DEX saves**, roll 2d20 and take the lowest result. Once per day you see something significant (ask your Guide what it is). 
1. **Seventh Son of a Seventh Son:** Enough exposure has shifted and changed you. You are more connected to the otherworldly. Add chaos magic to your character sheet and follow the rules. This new power is great, and terrible.   The first time you use a spell it causes 1d6 stress. Your second spell causes 1d4 stress. Finally the third spell you cast causes 1 stress. 
1. **Marked by Fear** The core of your being has been twisted and changed. When you act in a way that manifests your marked fear and have to make a save, roll 2d20 and take the lowest result. When you resist an opportunity to indulge the fear, take 1d4 stress.  Create a fundamental fear with your Guide. 
1. **Heavy is the head:** An ethereal crown hangs above your head. It is not visible to all, only a special few. Tales have been told of your coming.   Make a WIL save. If you pass, increase your max WIL by 1d6. 
1. **Full to Bursting:** You have a feeling of fullness and contentment.  Next time you would fail a critical damage STR save:  you succeed instead. Immediately and violently begin to vomit vermin (player’s choice).  Any being that can see they must make a WIL save or take 1d6 stress.  Roll 3d6. If the total is higher than your max WIL, take the new result.
1. **Progeny:** Something is growing inside of you. Hope has long since abandoned it, and it has no more room for dreams.  Roll 2d6. Take the new result as your max HP.
1. **Fate’s Web** _(this can only be taken once per character but multiple times per table)_: At least a puppet can see the strings that bind it, if only you were so lucky.  Roll on the [Omens and Magical Catastrophes](https://goblinarchives.github.io/Liminal Horror System/Magic/Omens-and-Catastrophes) table. 
1. **The Hunt:** Patronage is a dangerous thing. It becomes harder to ignore the primal impulses that burn deep inside you. Your attacks are **Enhanced** Critical Damage mutilates your body but you can continue to act.  You become the primary target of otherworldly and attacks made against you are **Enhanced**. 
1. **Doomed** _(this can be taken multiple times per character)_:  You have been branded for sacrifice, anointed for doom. If your next critical save against damage is a failure, you die horribly. If it is a success, you roll 3d6 + the number of times you’ve taken Doomed. If the total is higher than your max HP, take the new result.


# Vehicle Rules

## Vehicle Attributes
+ Vehicles have 2 attributes, STR and DEX.
+ STR represents the engine power and toughness of the vehicle.
+ DEX represents the acceleration and maneuverability of the vehicle.

## Vehicle Saving Throws
+ Vehicles roll STR saves using their STR.
+ Vehicles roll DEX saves using the _lower_ of the vehicle's DEX or the driver's DEX. A good driver can benefit from a responsive vehicle, and vice verse.
+ Vehicles are immune to anything requiring a WIL save, if needed for some reason, use the driver's WIL.

## Harm Protection
Vehicles do not have HP, and use the driver's HP to avoid attacks.

## Vehicle Armor Class
Most vehicles have 1 point of AC. Open vehicles like motorcycles have no armor, while military vehicles like APCs can have up to 3 AC. Armor also protects the occupants from damage if they are attacked directly.

## Vehicle Weapons
Most vehicles do not have weapons, and personal attacks from a vehicle are not enhanced. If an enclosed motor vehicle has a mounted weapon, that weapon is treated as part of the detachment, and its attacks are enhanced.

## Ramming and Crashes
Ramming or crashing causes damage to both the vehicle, whatever it hits, and the people inside, depending on the relative speed: Street (d6), Road (d8), or Highway (d10).

## Vehicle Damage
When the driver is out of HP, remaining damage is done to the vehicle's STR, and then the vehicle must make a STR save or something goes wrong: a flat tire, leaking fuel, a door falls off, etc.

## Chases
The winner of a vehicle chase can be determined in two different ways.

1. One of the two vehicles is faster. Example, a sedan chasing a bicycle. The faster one wins unless the slower one can compensate for it somehow. Example, a mountain bike cutting across rough terrain where a sedan cannot easily follow.
2. The two vehicles have similar speeds. Like in any other conflict, the fleeing vehicle must make a DEX save to escape.

## Hazards
Each turn of a chase, the Guide should introduce one or more hazards, depending on the fiction. Dealing with hazards usually require some kind of saving throw. Examples include:

+ Slow vehicles, red lights, stop signs
+ Parked cars, police barricades, construction zones
+ Tight corners, one-way streets, rough terrain
+ Pedestrians cross the street, bystanders call 911, a reporter takes a photo

## Common Metals
Common metals are frequently found in ruins, and can be sold in most scrapyards with no questions asked. Selling prices are listed below:

|Common Metal|Price|
|--|--|
|Iron  |$0.05/lb|
|Steel  |$0.25/lb|
|Aluminum   |$1/lb|
|Zinc|$1/lb|
|Lead  |$1/lb|
|Copper  |$5/lb|
|Tin   |$10/lb|

## Precious Metals
Gold and silver are not commonly found in ruins, but you can sometimes find gold and silver bars hidden in caches left over from the crack wars of the 1980s. They can be sold by weight at many jewelry stores and melted down with no questions asked at 50% market price. Precious metals are measured by troy ounce (14 troy oz = 1 lb) at the selling prices listed below. Platinum, palladium, and rhodium are three related metals commonly extracted from stolen catalytic converters, and the metals from a single converter can get you about $200.

|Precious Metal|Market price per troy oz|
|--|--|
|Silver|$25|
|Platinum|$700|
|Palladium|$750|
|Gold|$1,750|
|Rhodium|$4,000|

## Gemstones
Gem prices vary wildly based on carat, color, clarity, cut, and heat treating. You can sell looted games to shady jewelry stores at about 75% market price, but the process is a lot slower than selling scrap because the gems have to be graded, which can take weeks.

|Gemstone name|Type|Market price per carat|
|--|--|--|
|Diamond|Precious Stone|$1,000-$100,000|

## Artifacts
While many artifacts are museum pieces and could fetch tens of thousands of dollars at an auction, selling them on the streets will generally get you 3d6 x $100.

# Oracles

Oracles are used to make random decisions, and are mostly used in solo play.

# Exploration Procedures

## The Basics

+ The exploration cycle (see below) is divided into a series of Turns, Actions, and their consequences.
+ On their Turn, a character can move a distance equal to their torchlight’s perimeter (about 40ft), and perform one Action. Players can use their action to move up to three times that distance, though that will increase the chance of triggering a roll on the Dungeon Events table.
+ The Warden should present obvious information about an area and its dangers freely and at no cost. Moving quickly or without caution may increase the chance of encountering a wandering monster, springing a trap, or triggering a roll on the Dungeon Events table.

## Exploration Cycle
1. The Warden describes the party’s surroundings and any immediate dangers  (combat, traps, surprises, etc.). The players then declare their character’s intended movements and Actions.
2. The Warden resolves the actions of each character simultaneously, along with any actions that are already in progress. Remember, the Die of Fate can be a useful tool whenever the Warden is in doubt!
3. The players record any loss of resources and any new conditions (i.e. item use, deprivation, etc). The cycle then begins again. If appropriate, the Warden should roll on the Dungeon Events table. Keep common sense in mind when interpreting the results!

## Exploration Events
Explorations are always dangerous, and time must always be weighed against the risk of awakening the location’s denizens, natural hazards, and worse.

When the crew:
+ Spends more than one dungeon cycle in a single room or location.
+ Moves quickly or haphazardly through a room.
+ Moves into a new area, level, or zone.
+ Creates a loud disturbance.

Roll on the table below:

**d6 Exploration Events**
1. Encounter Roll on an encounter table. Possibly hostile (see Reactions (pg. 64)).
2. Sign A clue, “spoor,” track, abandoned lair, scent, victim, droppings, etc is discovered.
3. Environment Surroundings shift or escalate. Water rises, ceilings collapse,a ritual nears completion, etc.
4. Loss Torches are blown out, an ongoing spell fizzles, etc. The party must resolve the effects before moving on.
5. Exhaustion The party must take a brief rest (roll on this table again), add a Fatigue, or consume a ration.
6. Quiet The party is left alone (and safe) for the time being.

## Actions
+ Actions are any non-passive activities such as searching for traps, forcing open a door, listening for danger, disarming a trap, engaging an enemy in combat, casting a spell, dodging a trap, running away, resting, etc.
+ Some actions have special rules (see below), while others may take multiple turns to complete.
+ Loud or noticeable actions may also trigger an encounter of the dungeon’s denizens.

## Searching
+ A character can spend a turn performing an exhaustive search of one object or location in an area, revealing any relevant hidden treasure, traps, secret doors, etc.
+ Larger rooms and difficult or complex terrain may take a few turns to properly search.
+ Searching a room first is a safer way to explore, but it has a steep cost: time.

## Resting
+ A character can spend a turn resting to restore all HP.
+ A light source and a safe location are required to rest. Present or oncoming danger make rest impossible.
Resting does not restore Fatigue, as it is impossible to safely Make Camp in an exploration.

## Panic
+ A character that is surrounded by enemies, enveloped by darkness, or facing their greatest fears may experience panic. A WIL save is typically required to avoid losing control and becoming panicked.
+ A panicked character must make a WIL save to overcome their condition as an action on their turn.
+ A panicked character has 0 HP, does not act in the first round of combat, and all of their attacks are impaired.

# Unarmed Combat

Unarmed (d4, close)
Fight Dirty (d6, close, stress)
Takedown (STR contest, winner/loser has future attacks enhanced/impaired until escaped)
Escape/Submit (On the Ground Only, the winner escapes or forces a submission)

# Rules Summary

**ABILITIES**  
**STR:** Physicality, brawn &amp; toughness.  
**DEX:** Speed, sneaking &amp; precision.  
**WIL:** Wisdom, charm &amp; weirdness.

**SAVES** Roll d20 equal to or under target Ability. The being at most risk in a contested action makes the save.

**HIT PROTECTION**  
**HP** reflects a character’s ability to avoid damage (both from damage and stress).

**HEALING**  
A quick rest fully restores HP but can leave the investigators exposed. **Ability** loss requires a week’s rest with medical intervention or magical means.

**DEPRIVATION**  
**Deprived** keeps a PC from recovering HP. Being deprived for more than 24hrs adds Fatigue to a PCs inventory. **Fatigue** takes up one slot and lasts until they can recuperate. This can happen multiple times

**INVENTORY**  
PCs have 10 inventory slots. Most items take up one slot. **Bulky** items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. All 10 slots being in use lowers HP to 0.

**MAGIC**  
TBD. If deprived or in danger, a WIL save may be required to avoid dire consequences.

**ACTIONS**  
On their turn, characters may move 40ft and take a single action. Actions are casting a spell, attacking, additional movement, or some other reasonable action. These take place simultaneously.

**Retreating** from a doomed situation requires a successful DEX save and a safe destination.

For the **Start of Combat** round, characters must pass an DEX save in order to act. Subsequent turns have players acting, then adversaries.

**COMBAT**  
All attacks automatically hit. Attackers roll their **Stress** or **Damage** die, subtract any protections from **Armor** (damage) or **Stability** (stress), and deal the remaining total to the opponent’s HP. Excess damage is dealt to STR and excess stress is dealt to CTRL.

If there are **Multiple attackers**, or one using two weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

**Unarmed** attacks always do 1d4 damage. **Impaired** attacks (position of weakness) reduce damage die to 1d4. Shooting into cover is Impaired. **Enhanced** attacks (position of advantage) increase damage die to 1d12. **Blast** affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

**DAMAGE**  
Damage that exceeds the remaining HP applies the excess to STR. They must then make a STR save to avoid **critical damage**. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated.

Having STR 0 means **death**; having DEX 0 is paralysis; having CTRL 0 they are lost.

**STRESS &amp; FALLOUT**  
Player chooses from the [Stress Fallout](https://goblinarchives.github.io/LiminalHorror/Liminal%20Horror%20System/Stress%20and%20Fallout/) table when either:

- A PC takes critical stress (when they fail a CTRL save after it takes Ability damage)

Each Stress Fallout entry:

- Can only be chosen once at the table (unless denoted).
- Consumes an inventory slot.
