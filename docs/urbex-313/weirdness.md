# Abductee

You were abducted and experimented on by the mutants that live beneath the city. You escaped, and took one of their ray guns with you. They are still hunting for you.

> In the real world, in the 1940s, Dick Shaver (his real name) reported being abducted by evil humanoid mutants living under the city though records show he was in a mental instituion at the time. He later published his accounts in the form of sci-fi stories.

**Starting Gear**
+ Radon sampling tube, photomultiplier tube, and alpha counter (#bulky)

**What type of ray gun did you take?**

Subterran ray guns have 3 charges, and can be recharged by exposing them to radioactive radon gas (typically found underground) for 24 hours. Your starting gear allows you to detect radon gas.

1. **Fear ray**: Targets must make a WIL save or flee (d4 stress, #blast, #far).
1. **Guard ray**: Projects a body-hugging force field (+1 AC)
1. **Medical probe**: Can diagnose and treat most illnesses or injuries, but must be applied rectally. (heals d6 STR loss)

# Bearwalker

You used to hunt bears, until the day you killed a sentient bear. When you wore its skin you transformed into a bear and murdered your loved ones in a fit of rage. Now you are a monster from Ojibe legend known as an _otgont_ or _bearwalker_. Maybe you want to break the curse and redeem yourself, or maybe you revel in it and want to kill again.

> In the real world, the bearwalker legend is described in _Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers_ by Richard Dorson.

**Starting Bundle**
+ Bearskin (+1 AC, bearwalk #focus)
+ Bearclaw necklace (#focus)

**What can you do as a black bear?**
To use your bearwalking powers you must wear the focus for the power. Each focus occupies a body inventory slot. Your powers do not cost fatigue. You can aquire additional bearwalker powers by finding additional focus items during your explorations.

**Bearwalk**: You may change into a black bear at will, and your inventory transforms with you, but you take d4 stress. Transforming back into a human also causes d4 stress. Stability protects against this stress as normal. The more time you spend as a bear, the more bearlike your behavior becomes.

Your kind have used their stealth and magical skills to move undetected through the forests for thousands of years. Now, you live in the Motor City, which is weird enough that half the time you don't even have to hide.

> In the real world, there have been bigfoot sightings in Detroit.

**Starting Gear**
+ Human disguise

**What can you do as a bigfoot?**

Your bigfoot powers reduce your maximum fatigue, occupying an inventory slot. Your powers can also be charged for an additional effect, at the cost of d4 stress. Stability protects against this stress as normal. You can learn more bigfoot powers by discovering bigfoot totems during your explorations.

All bigfeet have the following power:

**Invisibility**: When you hide, people can only see you if you fail a DEX save. Charge to actually turn invisible while standing still. When moving, a slight blur gives your position away (attacks against you are impaired, costs d4 stress, lasts 1 hour).

# Bloodstopper

You have the ability, given to you by God, to stop bleeding and heal wounds in humans and animals. This is known as _bloodstopping_. You don't have to be a Chrsitian or believe in God for your abilities to work.

> In the real world, belief in bloodstopping is most common in the Ozarks, but it has also been reported in the Upper Penninsula of Michigan.

**Starting Gear**
+ Holy Bible (Bloodstop #focus)
+ Crucifix (#focus)

**What can your blodstopping do?**

Bloodstopping requires a ritual. The most common ritual is: you must face East and recite Ezekiel 16:6, also known as the _blood verse_: "And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live." Then touch the subject's wound.

To use each ability, you must hold the focus for that ability in one of your hands while performing the ritual. Using an ability costs 1 fatigue. Using an ability under duress requires a WIL save, or something goes wrong. You can learn more bloodstopping abilities by finding holy books during your explorations.

# Cyborg

Your body has been enhanced with electronics and machinery by a government agency or drug cartel.

This leaves you beholden to the CIA, the Sinaloa cartel, or some other organization to maintain a supply of the potions.

**Starting Gear**
+ Anti-rejection potions (focus)

**What is your cybernetic enhancement?**

Cybernetic enhancements take up a permanent inventory slot, and cannot be dropped or stolen, though they can be damaged. They can also be **charged** at the cost of 1 fatigue, granting them an extra bonus.

1. **Cyberarms**: 1d6 unarmed damage. If you have 2 free hands you can attack twice for d6+d6. Charge for a 1d10 punch that breaks through obstacles.

# DJ

In the same way that ancient bards could create magic with their music, you create magic with your mixes. Techno raves in Detroit's abandoned factories were popular back in the 80s and early 90s, but they died out as hip-hop conquered the world. Still, many DJs soldier on, making their magical mixes and hoping to hit it big in Europe.

**Starting Gear**
+ 3 vinyl single records (#focus, #petty)
+ Portable turntable and tape recorder (#bulky, #focus) 

**What tracks have you mixed?**

To use DJ magic, you require bulky DJ gear. This gear does not require electricity or speakers - the music is generated magically. You also have a number of vinyl record singles. You start with one effect track, one element track, and one form track. Because your magic taps into the ley lines that criss-cross the city, the records are all tied to Detroit in some way.

To create a spell, take a short rest and combine two tracks in one of the patterns listed below. A spell mix is a petty item recorded on tape or burned to CD. Work with the Guide to determine exactly what the spell does. You can even recombine the same tracks to create a new mix with a different effect. You can expand your library of records and mixes by finding new new ones during your explorations.

+ Effect + Element
+ Effect + Form
+ Element + Form

_Example_: If you kow Avenging, Light, and Sphere, you can create the following mixes:

# Dogman

When the French settled Detroit, they untionally brought along the _loup-garou_, commonly known as _werewolves_, people who survived being bitten by a werewolf and now become werewolves themselves. As wolves were hunted to near-extinction in Michigan, the loup-garou curse changed over time. Now werewolves transform into fearsome human-dog hybrids, known as _dogmen_, or to use the gender-neutral term, _dog-kin_.

**Starting Gear**

# Rootworker

Unlike Vodou, which is a religion, root work, also known as _Hoodoo_ or _Conjure_, is a set of magical and spiritual practices, and more influenced by Protestantism than Catholicism. Root workers use potions, oils, and candles to achive magical effects. Root work is normally associated with the deep south, but during the boom years of the auto industry, many southern African Americans traveled north for work, and brought Hoodoo with them.

The slavic word for spell-chaser varies by language, but most people use the Russian _колдунья_, roughly pronounced "koldunya" (feminine) or "koldun" (masculine).

> In the real world, in the 1800s, spiritualism was popular in rural Michigan. However, it fell out of favor in the early part of the 20th century as skeptics provided evidence that the trappings of spiritualism like seances, channeling, and automatic writing were all hoaxes.

You are a _witch_, trained in the slavic magical arts of curses and demon summoning. In Odd Detroit, this training is mostly found amongst western slavs (Poles), southern slavs (Bulgarians), and eastern slavs (Russians). The slavic word for witch varies by language, but most people use the Russian _Ведьма_, roughly pronounced "vetchma" (feminine) or "vetch" (masculine).
