Oracles allow you to play the game solo, and take some of the decision making work off of the GM.

### Question Oracle

If you have a question about the world, use the Question Oracle to get your answer. Roll a die depending on how likely the answer is to be "yes".

**Chance of YES**

- *Very unlikely*: d6
- *Unlikely*: d8
- *50/50*: d10
- *Likely*: d12
- *Very likely*: d20

**Results**

- *1-2*: no, and…
- *3-4*: no.
- *5-6*: yes, but…
- *7-8*: yes.
- *9+*: yes, and…

### Risk Oracle

If your explorer wants to attempt something dangerous, use the Risk Oracle to assess how risky it is before doing it. Roll 2d6, sum the two numbers, and interpret the results.

- 2-4: the situation is not risky at all. You simply do it.
- 5-9: the situation is risky. Make a check to see how it goes.
- 10-12: the situation is perilous. Face a challenge with 1d4+1 checks.
