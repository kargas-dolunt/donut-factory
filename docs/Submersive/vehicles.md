The two basic types of underwater vehicles are submarines and submersibles.

Submarines
: Submarines are vehicles capable of operating underwater or on the surface for extended periods of time. They have a limited dive depth.

Submersibles
: Submersibles are vehicles that must be transported on and supported by a surface vessel. They are able to dive much deeper than submarines.
