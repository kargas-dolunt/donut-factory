Ecology is the branch of biology which studies the interactions among organisms and their environment.

## Community Ecology

Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area.

## Ecosystem Ecology

Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials between different pools.

## Industrial Ecology

Industrial ecology is the study of material and energy flows through industrial systems.

## Population Ecology

Population ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the environment.

## Spatial Ecology

Spatial ecology studies the ultimate distributional or spatial unit occupied by a species.

### Landscape Ecology

Landscape ecology is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems.

## Social Ecology

Social ecology studies relationships between people and their environment, often the interdependence of people, collectives and institutions.

## Systems Ecology

Systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field of ecology that takes a holistic approach to the study of ecosystems.

## Theoretical Ecology

Theoretical ecology is the study of ecological systems using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis.

## Urban Ecology

Urban ecology is the scientific study of the relation of living organisms with each other and their surroundings in the context of an urban environment.
