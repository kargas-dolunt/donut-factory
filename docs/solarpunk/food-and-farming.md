## Permaculture

Permaculture is a practical design philosophy intended to help us live and prosper in an environment, while working with nature in a positive way, using solutions based on careful observation of natural ecosystems and common sense.

### Simple foods to grow at home

#### Sprouts

Sprouts are very easy to grow at home. Alfalfa seeds, mung beans, chickpeas and many others provide great nutrition while costing very little and taking almost no time at all to get started.

Soak the seeds / beans in water overnight, then put them (damp) into a _clean_ jam jar and rinse at least every day. They should start sprouting pretty quickly and can be eaten after a few days (at whatever stage you want really). If kept in the fridge once ready, they should keep longer as it slows their growth.

Be aware of salmonella and E. coli: unclean practices and leaving the sprouts too long without rinsing increases the likelihood of getting food poisoning. Keep jam jars clean and rinse the sprouts often.

#### Basil

Basil is a plant that under the right conditions can exponentially propagate. Take cuttings of a plant, with some yield, and put them in water. Once the roots have grown long, transplant each of the cuttings into pots. This can be repeated enough times to quickly [grow more than you can eat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byoEBdVoVpM "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byoEBdVoVpM").

Goats are versatile, hardy, and smart. In addition to their meat and milk, they are excellent at clearing brush. Their resilient nature and browsing habits make them perfect for dry areas.

There are two main types of goat breeds: meat, and dairy. Below are the most common breeds in each category:
