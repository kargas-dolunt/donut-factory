As Solar Punk envisions a free and egalitarian world, its politics take the form of Libertarian Socialism; a group of anti-authoritarian political philosophies inside the socialist movement that rejects the conception of socialism as centralized state ownership and control of the economy. Libertarian socialism criticizes wage labour relationships within the workplace, instead emphasizing workers' self-management of the workplace and decentralized structures of directly democratic political organization. It often rejects the state itself, and asserts that a society based on freedom and justice can be achieved through abolishing authoritarian institutions that control certain means of production and subordinate the majority to an owning class or political and economic elite. All of this is generally done within a general call for libertarian and voluntary human relationships through the identification, criticism, and practical dismantling of illegitimate authority in all aspects of human life.

## Anarchism

![Anarchy Logo: A black letter A enclosed in a black circle ](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=175&tok=677365&media=1200px-anarchy-symbol.svg.png "Anarchy Logo: A black letter A enclosed in a black circle ") [Anarchism](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/doku.php?id=anarchism "anarchism") is a political philosophy that advocates self-governed societies based on voluntary, cooperative stateless societies, rejecting hierarchies they view as unjust. Anarchism holds capitalism, the state, and representative democracy to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. Anarchism specifically entails opposing authority or hierarchical organization in the conduct of all human relations. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, ranging from collectivism to individualism, not all of which are mutually exclusive.

## Left Communism

![](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&tok=defc56&media=left_communism.png) [Left Communism](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/doku.php?id=leftcommunism "leftcommunism") refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the anti-authoritarian aspects of Marxism. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as left communism, emerged in opposition to Marxist-Leninist vanguardism, it is also often critical of reformist positions, such as those held by social democrats. Libertarian Marxist currents emphasize the Marxist belief in the ability of the working class to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or state to mediate or aid its liberation.

## Social Ecology and Communalism

![Communalism Logo: A black star outlined in red enclosed in a brown wheel with green spokes](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=200&tok=732108&media=communalism_according_to_bookchin_by_mylittletripod-d829twv.png "Communalism Logo: A black star outlined in red enclosed in a brown wheel with green spokes") [Communalism](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/doku.php?id=communalism "communalism") is a system of government in which virtually autonomous local communities are brought together in a confederation under the principles and practice of communal ownership. Social Ecology is its recognition of the often-overlooked fact that nearly all our present ecological problems arise from deep-seated social problems.
