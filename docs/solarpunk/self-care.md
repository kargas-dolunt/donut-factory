## Activities of Daily Living

[Activities of Daily Living](https://wiki.sunbeam.city/doku.php?id=self-care:activities-of-daily-living "self-care:activities-of-daily-living") includes topics about personal hygeine, sleeping, eating and nutrition, medication, housekeeping, managing money, moving, food safety, preparing meals, grocery shopping, and communication. Many of the topics in this section provide examples of what tasks may be part of someone's day to day life and may be useful when trying to achieve personal self-care goals.

One example of a place to start when it comes to practicing self-care in your daily activities is the 6-3-1 Rule below.

### TLDR: The 6-3-1 Rule

At the [Chaos Communications Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress"), hackers are encouraged to follow the 6-3-1 rule. That means a minimum of six hours of sleep, three meals per day and one shower. It's sometimes easy to forget the basics of caring for one's self and those around you. This is a good basic starting point for most people.

## Health care

[Free medicine for everyone](https://fourthievesvinegar.org "https://fourthievesvinegar.org") People are disenfranchised from access to medicine for various reasons. To circumvent these, we have developed a way for individuals to manufacture their own medications. We have designed an open-source automated lab reactor, which can be built with off-the-shelf parts, and can be set to synthesize different medications.
